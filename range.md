Range is a naval combat game with with tactical depth and risk-reward decision-making.

## The Core Innovation

Forget binary hit-or-miss gameplay. Range introduces a variable blast radius system that completely changes the tactical landscape. Every shot you fire requires a critical decision: do you use a precise strike for devastating damage, or cast a wide net to gather intelligence?

## Three Ways to Strike

- Small Blast: A surgical strike dealing maximum damage to a single tile - powerful enough to obliterate a ship segment in one shot, but you need pinpoint accuracy
- Medium Blast: Covers 5 tiles with medium damage each - the balanced approach for confirmed targets
- Large Blast: Blankets 13 tiles with light damage - perfect for reconnaissance

## Strategic Depth

HP System: Ships have 10 HP per segment. A Carrier packs 50 total HP, meaning battles become wars of attrition where you track structural degradation across the entire enemy fleet.

## Victory Conditions

Sink the entire enemy fleet or survive 50 turns with the highest remaining HP. Every point of damage counts toward your score, making even scouting shots meaningful contributions to victory.

Range takes everything you loved from similar games and adds layers of strategy to create a modern naval combat experience that rewards both aggressive play and patient reconnaissance.
